<h1>NottinghamBot</h1>

<h2> Background </h2>

When I started studying computer science at the university, me and my friends found out we need all sorts of features to our IRC channel - most important being operator management since IRCnet doesn't provide server level bots like Quakenet's Q. So it started with that and soon started to expand to fulfill our daily needs.

<h2> Features </h2>

<ul>
<li> <b> Operation management </b> <br />
     User can list admins to configuration file and the bot will automatically give them +o when they join the channel. This way we can avoid the situation where people come and go and we end up with no one being an operator.
</li>
</ul>
